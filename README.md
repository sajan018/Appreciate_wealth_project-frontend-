# fruit.ai

## Overview

**fruit.ai** is a web application that combines the power of Flask, MongoDB, and React to provide an interactive experience for users. The application allows users to view content and interact with a chatbot for suggestions. It includes features for managing FAQs with user authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can upload FAQs and that each user can only edit or delete their own submissions.

## Features

- **Public Access**: Any user can view routes and access general information.
- **FAQ Management**: Upload FAQs with user authentication. Only authenticated users can upload FAQs, and each user can edit or delete only their own FAQs.
- **Chatbot Integration**: An intelligent chatbot provides suggestions based on user input.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration.
